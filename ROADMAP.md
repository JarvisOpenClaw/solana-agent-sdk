## 🚧 Phase 2: Agent Intelligence (Q1 2026)

### Enhanced NLP
- [ ] Context-aware intent parsing (conversation memory)
- [ ] Multi-step transaction planning
- [ ] Ambiguity resolution ("which SOL pool do you mean?")
- [ ] Support for DeFi strategies ("maximize yield on 100 USDC")

### Advanced Safety
- [ ] Portfolio risk scoring
- [ ] Real-time price impact analysis
- [ ] Smart slippage calculation (volatility-aware)
- [ ] Gas estimation with fee spike protection
- [ ] Whitelist/blacklist token filtering
- [ ] Daily/weekly spending limits

### Autonomous Features
- [ ] Auto-compounding (claim + reinvest yields)
- [ ] Rebalancing strategies (maintain target allocation)
- [ ] DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging) execution
- [ ] Stop-loss / take-profit automation

## 🎯 Phase 3: Production Scale (Q2 2026)

### Performance
- [ ] Batch transaction support
- [ ] Parallel RPC queries
- [ ] Local transaction caching
- [ ] Priority fee optimization
- [ ] Retry logic with exponential backoff

### Monitoring
- [ ] Transaction history tracking
- [ ] Performance metrics (success rate, avg fees)
- [ ] Alert system (stuck txs, failed ops)
- [ ] Portfolio analytics

### DeFi Expansion
- [ ] Orca liquidity pools
- [ ] Raydium swaps & farms
- [ ] Marinade liquid staking
- [ ] Meteora dynamic AMM
- [ ] Mango Markets integration

- [ ] Shared liquidity pools (agent coalitions)
- [ ] Payment rails (Blinks + x402)
- [ ] Trust scoring (reputation system)

### Developer Experience
- [ ] Visual transaction debugger
- [ ] Playground UI (test strategies without code)
- [ ] Agent templates (trading bot, yield optimizer, etc.)
- [ ] Plugin system (custom modules)

### Security
- [ ] Formal verification of safety rules
- [ ] Audit trail (all agent actions logged)
- [ ] Emergency pause mechanism
- [ ] Sandboxed testing environment

---

## 🔮 Phase 5: Next-Gen Features (Q4 2026)

### AI-Native
- [ ] Model fine-tuning on Solana patterns
- [ ] Predictive transaction success scoring
- [ ] Anomaly detection (unusual behavior)
- [ ] Natural language portfolio reporting

### Advanced DeFi
- [ ] Cross-chain swaps (Solana ↔ EVM)
- [ ] Flash loans
- [ ] Arbitrage detection & execution
- [ ] Liquidation protection
- [ ] NFT operations (buy/sell/appraise)

### Governance
- [ ] DAO voting (on-chain proposals)
- [ ] Multi-agent coordination protocols
- [ ] Dispute resolution mechanisms

## 🎁 Community Wishlist

**What agents need most** (from forum feedback):

1. **Identity module** — Reputation, credentials, trust scores
2. **State persistence** — Remember past decisions across restarts
3. **Composability** — Easy integration with other agent tools
4. **Error recovery** — Graceful degradation when services fail
5. **Cost tracking** — Know exactly how much each operation costs
